# DESCRIPTION

## EnumerableSet

_Library for managing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive
types.

Sets have the following properties:

- Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
(O(1)).
- Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.

```solidity
contract Example {
    // Add the library methods
    using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;

    // Declare a set state variable
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
}
```

As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)
and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.

[WARNING]
====
Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
unusable.
See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.

In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
array of EnumerableSet.

### Functions:
### add

```solidity
function add(struct EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set set, bytes32 value) internal returns (bool)
```

_Add a value to a set. O(1).

Returns true if the value was added to the set, that is if it was not
already present._

### remove

```solidity
function remove(struct EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set set, bytes32 value) internal returns (bool)
```

_Removes a value from a set. O(1).

Returns true if the value was removed from the set, that is if it was
present._

### contains

```solidity
function contains(struct EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set set, bytes32 value) internal view returns (bool)
```

WARNING: This operation will copy the entire storage to memory, which can be quite expensive. This is designed
to mostly be used by view accessors that are queried without any gas fees. Developers should keep in mind that
this function has an unbounded cost, and using it as part of a state-changing function may render the function
uncallable if the set grows to a point where copying to memory consumes too much gas to fit in a block._

## ERC165

_Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.

Contracts that want to implement ERC165 should inherit from this contract and override {supportsInterface} to check

    return interfaceId == type(MyInterface).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);

## AccessControl

_Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
{AccessControlEnumerable}.

Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
using `public constant` hash digests:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
```

Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
function call, use {hasRole}:

```solidity
function foo() public {
    require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
    ...
}
```

Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
{revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
{_setRoleAdmin}.

WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}
to enforce additional security measures for this role._

```

Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
{revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
{_setRoleAdmin}.

WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}
to enforce additional security measures for this role.

purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges
if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced).

event.

Requirements:

## ERC20

_Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].

The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
this function so it returns a different value.

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
applications.

Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}._

### Functions:
### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string name_, string symbol_) public
```

_Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.

All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction._

### name

```solidity
function name() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless
it's overridden.

{Pausable-_pause} and {Pausable-_unpause} internal functions, with appropriate
access control, e.g. using {AccessControl} or {Ownable}. Not doing so will

event.

Requirements:

- the caller must be `account`.

checks on the calling account.

May emit a {RoleGranted} event.

[WARNING]
====
This function should only be called from the constructor when setting
up the initial roles for the system.

Using this function in any other way is effectively circumventing the admin
system imposed by {AccessControl}.
